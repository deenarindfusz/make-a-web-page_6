            <br>
            <br>
            <em> You</em> and your <em>computer</em> connect to the <em>Internet</em> which uses <em <em> HTTP</em> to connect to <em>servers</em>.
            <br> You have to tell the have to tell your computer what you want your website to look like.
            <br> Webpages are text documents written is a language called <em>HTML - Hypertext Markup Langauage.</em>

      <p>We learned a lot about how Markup uses <em>tags, elements, attributes, and sources </em> to create our webpage.
        <br> HTML tags are code that describe how a web page is formatted. They are defined by the characters inside a set of brackets. Most tags come in a set of 2, an opening tag &lt; &gt;and a closing tag &lt; / &gt;.
        <br> Elements are compiled of opening tags, content and closing tags.
        <br> Attributes provide additional information about an element.
        <br> Source elements are used to define the media resource for your pictures and videos.
        <br> We touched on inline and block tags along with Span and Div elemements but we"ll learn more about those later.4&gt; We also learned that if we can't remember all the tags go to
        <a href="http://www.Google.com"> <b>GOOGLE</b></a>

      <b>HTML Document Structure</b>
      <div class="Topic-description">
        <p> HTML documents are made up of more than tags. They contain a head and body sections. The head contains metadata and other random stuff.
          <br> The body contains all the actual contents of the document. This diagram shows the structure of an HTML Document.

            <div>Before you start to code your website, visualize what you want it to look like.
              <br> Draw it out on a piece of paper to get an idea of what it will look like.
              <br> This way you can make sure the site will look like you want it.
              <br> <b>Remember to </b><em><b><u>View it</u> </b></em> before <em><b><u>You do it</u></b>.

            <b>Boxes</b>
            <div class="Topic-description">
              <p>Boxes - everything on your website will be in a box. You have boxes inside of boxes. Things that don't look like a box are a box.
                <br>By selecting different attributes of the box you can change how the box looks. It can look like a circle, rectangle or triangle.

            <h4><b> CSS Styling in HTML</b></h4>
            <div class="Topic-Decription">
              <p>CSS styling is what is used to select the color, size and styles of the website. It sets the Font color and size, if text is bold or italic.
                <br>It sets the shape and color of objects that are loaded into the webite. This is done using attributes and selectors.
                <br> Beware of repetition. Repetition is repeating code in places where it has no meaning/value. This makes it difficult to read and troubleshoot what should actually be happening.
                <br>
                <br>3 things you need to remember when coding:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Code - Avoid Repetition. </li>
                <li> Test - Test your code for errors</li>
                <li>
                  Refine - Correct any errors that found</li>
              </ul>CSS is a powerful tool. Don't be afraid to play and experiment to find out which styles you want to use on your website.
